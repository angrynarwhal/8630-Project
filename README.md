# 8630-Project
Final Iterative Project for Graduate Data Visualization Class

## Get Data
1. Download the data file using the `data.py` program in the root of this repository. 
    - `python3 -m venv .venv` 
    - `source .venv/bin/activate`
    - `pip install --upgrade pip` # optional, but good practice
    - `pip install -r requirements.txt` # Note that the requirements.txt file does not lock library versions. I did it this way because the program and dependencies are simple, and leaving the library versions unlocked enables support for a wider range of python3 versions.
